# Open Source 3D Assets
A curated registry of free 3D assets for games, VR, and creative projects

🌐 [opensource3dassets.com](https://opensource3dassets.com)

## What is this?

A simple directory that helps you find 3D assets you can actually use. Whether you're building a game, creating VR experiences, or need environment models for the metaverse - we've collected links to assets with clear licensing so you know exactly what you can do with them.

## Quick Start

Just want assets? Visit [opensource3dassets.com](https://opensource3dassets.com) to browse and download.

## For Developers

### Simple Integration

```javascript
// Fetch available collections
const collections = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToxSam/open-source-3d-assets/main/data/projects.json')
  .then(r => r.json());

// Get assets from a collection
const assets = await fetch(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToxSam/open-source-3d-assets/main/data/${collections[0].asset_data_file}`)
  .then(r => r.json());

// Load the model
const modelUrl = assets[0].model_file_url;
```

### Need help loading 3D files?

- **Web**: Use [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with GLTFLoader
- **Unity**: Import GLB/FBX files directly
- **Unreal**: Use FBX or convert via Datasmith
- **Blender**: File > Import > glTF 2.0 or FBX
